# snv-calling
This project is aimed at extending CONET (https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-022-02693-z)
to inference of SNV on data with low coverage and large sampel size (i.e. number of cells). This is work in progress - so far we've implemented preliminary model for generating CONET with SNVs 
and simple ML algorithm for SNVs inference.
